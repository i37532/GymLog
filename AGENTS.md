# Working agreements for this repo

## Git
- NEVER run: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git reset`, `git rebase`, `git merge`.
- After code changes, ONLY output:
  1) a short summary of what changed
  2) a suggested Conventional Commit message (single line)
  3) the exact commands I should run manually (do not execute them)

## Command running
- You may run lint/tests (e.g. npm run lint / npm test) but ask before running long or destructive commands.
